# Operating System Principles

A challenging class about the principles of operating systems. I learned a lot about how operating systems work, and how to write C++ programs that interact with them.

## Course Description

Topics include processes, threads, concurrency, parallelism on multi-processor and multi-core systems, CPU scheduling, inter- process communication and synchronization, deadlocks, real and virtual memory management, device management, file systems, security, and protection.
