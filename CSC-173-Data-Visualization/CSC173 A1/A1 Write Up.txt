	For my visualization, I wanted to answer the question “Which columns best illustrate the equity gap between STEM and non-STEM students and what conclusion can you draw from them?” For my data visualizations, I made bar graphs that display the values of the columns that I found to be most relevant to the question, which I found to be ‘Pell’ and ‘First generation’ in the given data set. ‘Pell’ shows the percentage of students that are eligible for Pell grants, which are usually only rewards to those who are in desperate financial need and without a degree, and ‘First generation’ shows those that are undergraduates with parents who never enrolled in post-secondary education. Both of these groups are often used as indicators of socio-economic disadvantage, so differences in the representation of these groups in STEM and non-STEM fields can provide a measure of equity between these fields.
        Regarding the visualization type, I used bar graphs because they provide an effective way to compare quantitative data across multiple categories. I sorted each subject at CSUS and categorized them myself (manually unfortunately). I made 3 graphs, one with STEM student Pell and First generation measurements with all STEM subjects (small one in blue), one with all non-STEM subjects (larger one in blue), and a final one with the average for all non-STEM students (in purple). I calculated the means of the 'Pell' and 'First Generation' percentages for each subject, as this provides a more accurate representation of these categories across the whole dataset than would individual data points.
        Looking at the differences, AERO, EEE, and ME have the lowest amount of pell-eligible and first generation students. If I had to guess, students with a lower socio-economical status have a lower chance to being exposed to more advanced hardware, which is especially evident by AERO being a bit of an outlier.
