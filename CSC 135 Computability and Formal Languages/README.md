# Computability and Formal Languages

All of the homework PDFs have the questions included and the answers right below. They were all hand drawn in Notability. 

I loved this class - most of it was puzzle solving and applying pattern recognition to complete homework including finite state machines, finite automata, formal languages, and more.

## Course Description: 
Introduction to limits of computation and techniques for specifying and processing formal languages. Regular languages, regular expressions, finite automata, properties and limitations. Context-free languages, grammars, pushdown automata, properties and limitations. Applications in lexical and syntax analyses, including recursive-descent or table-driven parsing. Turing machines, halting problem, reductions. Introduction to functional programming and related programming language features.
