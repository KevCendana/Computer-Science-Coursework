## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# **Class**

Who used Word or Google docs to do the homework?

-   markdown is a totally general purpose "markup language" similar to HTML (CSS is a style sheet language)

-   markdown languages basically say what to render, not how to render it

# **Markdown Shortcuts**

-   inline code : double \`

    -   `5*2`

-   bold: double \_

    -   ***bold***

-   italics: single \_

    -   *italics*

-   header: any number of hashtag

# Math

insert -\> latex math -\> display math $$
y_i a x _i + b
$$

inline math: $y = ax+b$

# Plots:

```{r} [results = "hide"]}
plot(1:5)
```

# Advantages of markdown:

-   Very clean and easy to read

-   Only 1 window / software

-   Limited copy pasting and formatting

# Disadvantages of markdown:

-   Slight learning curve
