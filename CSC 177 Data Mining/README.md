# Data Mining
A fun class that I took in the Spring of 2021. I learned a lot about data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, classification, clustering, association rule mining, predictive model evaluation, parameter tuning, natural language processing, and selected advanced data mining topics. I also had a really cool group and professor, which helped a lot :)
